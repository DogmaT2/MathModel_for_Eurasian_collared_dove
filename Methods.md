# Invasive Species Modeling #
## The Spread of the Eurasian Collared Dove in the US ##
### Methods Used to Parameterize Model ###


To determine the agreement between our model and empirical data, we used abundance data  
for the Eurasian collared dove (EUCD) collected by the National Audubon Society (NAS),  
the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and the Canadian Wildlife Service (CWS).  
Specifically, we used data from the NAS Christmas bird count (CBC) and the USGS/CWS  
North American breeding bird survey (BBS). The CBC and BBS generate annual abundance  
records at numerous survey locations for all bird species occurring in North America.  
We used CBC records from 1971-2004, and BBS records from 1966-2004 which includes the  
period of introduction and invasion for the EUCD. The EUCD appears in BBS records  
beginning in 1986 and in CBC records beginning in 1987. To determine the effect of  
breeding season length on EUCD abundance, we estimated the breeding season length (BSL)  
using data on the number of frost-free days recorded at numerous weather stations in the  
USA. We acquired the data on frost free days from the US National Climatic Data Center  
(Asheville, NC).

We determined the annual occurrence and rate of geographic expansion for the EUCD in  
North America based on annual EUCD abundance data recorded by the CBC and BBS. The  
CBC and BBS data represent the number of birds observed in one or more  circular survey  
sites. 

A CBC survey site represents a single circle of 12 km radius and is censused by one or  
more observers over a single 24 hour period sometime within a two week window around  
Christmas (Bock & Root 1981). 

The BBS survey is performed along a 39.4 km linear route, with 50 separate survey  
circles located every 0.80 mile along each route (Droege 1990). Each BBS site is  
surveyed during the peak of the breeding season (May-July depending on location). The  
diameter of each BBS survey circle is approximately 800m, depending on topography and  
vegetation cover. Thus the BBS data represent a linear transect 40 km long and 0.80 km  
wide. During a BBS survey, each circle along the route is censused for a 3-minute  
period. The CBC and BBS data sets provide raw abundance data and the CBC data also  
includes density data (birds per hour and birds per mile). We converted the CBC birds  
per mile data to birds per km. To calculate the birds per km of the BBS data, we  
divided the total number of birds seen along the route by the length of the sum of the  
diameters of the survey circles (40 km). 

We determined the linear rate of expansion of the EUCD along a south to north corridor,  
from southern Florida north into Canada. We used to approaches to determine the length  
of the growing season (BSL). In the first approach, we estimated the relationship  
between latitude and BSL by fitting a curve to the data using a least-squares polynomial  
curve fit. We used the resulting polynomial to estimate the breeding season length at  
any given location along the corridor. In the second approach, we restricted our  
analysis to CBC and BBS sites that are found in the vicinity of weather stations. This  
second approach uses site-specific empirical data on BSL recorded at weather stations  
found along the corridor. We restricted our analysis to CBC and BBS sites found within  
10 miles of a weather station, and used the number of frost-free days recorded at the  
corresponding station as our estimate of BSL. The second approach is more precise than  
the first, but yields fewer data points.
